TimeTree Selenium App
---------------------  
TimeTree is ending it's API. I needed a way to insert Jewish holidays which follow the hebrew calendar, so I created this app which uses Selenium to automate a browser and enter the holidays in.  

Requirements
------------  
Set environment variables:  
**TIMETREE_EMAIL_ID**  
**TIMETREE_PASSWORD**
